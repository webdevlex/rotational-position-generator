* We will use a polar coordinate system (x,y) plane

define how long you would like animation to complete one full rotation (12 seconds)

define number of frames per second in animation (30 frames)

define direction of rotation (clock wise or counter clock wise)

calculate number of position changes to complete one full rotation in specified time and frame rate (
     360 postiion, 1 degree every 1/30th of a second )

center rotating object in parent

we will start at degree 0 then every 1/30th of a second we will calculate our x and y position using 
    sin(θ) and cos(θ) and translate our object that many pixels in the x and y direction
